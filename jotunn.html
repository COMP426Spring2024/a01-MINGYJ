        <h1>Jötunn-Giant Against God</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <ul>
                <li>In Norse mythology, the jötunn (or jotnar), commonly known as giants in Norse mythology, are formidable and enigmatic beings existing on the fringes of the cosmic order. These colossal entities embody the forces of nature, chaos, and primordial elements, standing apart from the Aesir and Vanir deities associated with stability. Jotnar are depicted as primal forces capable of both creation and destruction, representing the untamed aspects of the cosmos.</li>
                <li>The jotnar inhabit diverse realms, from the icy landscapes of Jotunheim to the fiery expanses of Muspellheim. Their interactions with divine powers lead to intricate narratives, with some giants depicted as malevolent figures and others forming alliances with the Aesir. The complex web of Norse cosmology blurs the lines between friend and foe in the dynamic relationships between these giants and the gods.</li>
