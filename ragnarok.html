        <h1>Ragnarök</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Ragnarök start with three long Fimbulvetr, an endless winter, which brings starving, war, and chaos to the world. Loki is released and the <a href="./jotunn.html">jotunns</a> march towards Ásgarðr.</p>
            <p>Prose Edda describe Surtr's role in Ragnarök as: "amid this turmoil the sky will open and from it will ride the sons of Muspell. Surtr will ride in front, and both before and behind him there will be burning fire. His sword will be very fine. Light will shine from it more brightly than from the sun."
            <br>"at the end of the world he will go and wage war and defeat all the gods and burn the whole world with fire".
            <br> During the fight between gods, Surtr fight againt Freyr, who lack his sword. After Surtr defeat Freyr, and once Heimdallr (son of Odin) and Loki mutally kills each other, Surtr throw his sword up into the key and burn the whole world, from heaven to earth.
            <br> After the devastation of whole world, the human will reborn from the ashes.  </p>
